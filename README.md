Galactic Kittens Online is a copy of Unity's Networking example project (Galactic Kittens) that is changed and now it includes a Quick Match button (Join Button) that uses Lobbies and Relays to search for an available lobby to join and if it doesn't find any, it becomes a host and creates its own lobby for others to join. 

The host button just skips the searching for lobbys part and just creates its own lobby. 

You can verify if you are on the same lobby if you have the same room code on the character selection screen.
